#Analysis Deep Dive 

Profit?? Based on # of items purchased? 


Follow-up Questions: 
•	I believe some clarity on the following questions could help me bring even more value to the above analysis and future targeted marketing campaigns. 
o	Background of the given data set including sample size, time period, and how the data was obtained. 
♣	I know Blackwell has only had ecommerce operations for the past year or so. I could better present my findings by knowing the time period of the data to determine if the amount spent includes hot buying times like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Additionally, since the data shows 80 thousand transactions total, with half being online and half being in store, I would like to know if this data was particularly selected to have such an even distribution of in store and online transactions. 
o	Number of current stores per region
♣	During my analysis I found that customers in the western region are primarily shopping online, so I would like to find out the number of store locations in this area to determine if there are a smaller number of store locations to prompt customers to shop online. Additionally, customers in the eastern region seem to be shopping much more in store, so this data could help me determine why this may be the case.
o	Past promotional activity 
♣	Were there any sort of promotions or sales sent to customers based on region to promote your online store? 
♣	As mentioned above, I found that customers in the western region are primarily shopping online. I want to determine if perhaps this customer base was send promotions that the other regions were not sent or if the online store was promoted to all regions, or no regions.
