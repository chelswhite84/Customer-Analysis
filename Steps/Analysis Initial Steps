I first needed to answer the questions presented to me by Blackwell. 

1.	Comparison of customer regions and their amount spent per transaction 
•	The Western Region spends the least with an average of $252 spent per transaction.
•	The Eastern Region has the next lowest spend with the majority of transactions totaling under $1,000.
•	Amount spent increases when we look at the Southern Region with transactions up to $3,000. 
•	The Central region spends the most with an average of $1,284 spent per transaction and nice distribution of purchases from $5 to $3,000. 

2.	Comparison of age of customers and their region
•	Older customers are more likely to be in the West region, especially for ages 74+ 
•	Younger customers (age 18-39) are more likely to be in the Central region with almost no customers over 65. 
•	Outside of those insights, the data does not reliably predict the age of a customer at a high degree of accuracy when comparing their region 

2.	Predict the amount spent per customer based on region, age, and in store and online comparisons.
•	Region gives the most predictive value for amount spent per customer per transaction when comparing online and in store with an accuracy of about 66%, the accuracy only goes down as you compare other customer factors.
•	The table below shows the amount a customer is predicted to spend online or in store based on their region.
•	The Western and Central regions are predicted to spend more in store than they currently spend online. 

2.	Correlation between age and in store/online purchases 
•	There is a low level of accuracy when attempting to predict whether a customer’s age will indicate if they will shop online or in store, except for the older customer segment, as shown in the graph below. 
•	Customers between 74-85 are only shopping online. 
•	The rest of the age groups show a pretty even distribution between online and in store transactions.
