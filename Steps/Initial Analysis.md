#Initial Analysis 
I first needed to answer the questions presented to me by Blackwell. 

1.	Comparison of customer regions and their amount spent per transaction 
•	The Western Region spends the least with an average of $252 spent per transaction.
•	The Eastern Region has the next lowest spend with the majority of transactions totaling under $1,000.
•	Amount spent increases when we look at the Southern Region with transactions up to $3,000. 
•	The Central region spends the most with an average of $1,284 spent per transaction and nice distribution of purchases from $5 to $3,000. 

2.	Comparison of age of customers and their region
•	Older customers are more likely to be in the West region, especially for ages 74+ 
•	Younger customers (age 18-39) are more likely to be in the Central region with almost no customers over 65. 
•	Outside of those insights, the data does not reliably predict the age of a customer at a high degree of accuracy when comparing their region 

2.	Predict the amount spent per customer based on region, age, and in store and online comparisons.
•	Region gives the most predictive value for amount spent per customer per transaction when comparing online and in store with an accuracy of about 66%, the accuracy only goes down as you compare other customer factors.
•	The table below shows the amount a customer is predicted to spend online or in store based on their region.
•	The Western and Central regions are predicted to spend more in store than they currently spend online. 

2.	Correlation between age and in store/online purchases 
•	There is a low level of accuracy when attempting to predict whether a customer’s age will indicate if they will shop online or in store, except for the older customer segment, as shown in the graph below. 
•	Customers between 74-85 are only shopping online. 
•	The rest of the age groups show a pretty even distribution between online and in store transactions. 



Summary of Customer Analysis and Marketing Recommendations 
•	Region is the most impactful on predicting the amount a customer will spend followed by their age and whether they shop in store or online. 
•	Increase in store transaction in the Western Region
o	Customers in this region are more likely to be in the older age group and are predicted to spend more in store than they are currently spending online.
♣	Suggested next steps: 
•	Increase the number of store locations in this region to prompt customers to visit a store location instead of shopping online. 
♣	Direct Mailers or televised commercials may be a more impactful marketing campaign for this age group than online or email promotions. 
♣	Offer a promotion to get customers in store, such as in store only coupons, in store pickup, or a free product giveaway if you visit the store.




•	Increase online transactions in the Eastern and Central Regions 
o	Customers in the Eastern region are only shopping online, so they are a hot region to focus on since their online engagement is currently untapped. 
o	Customers in the Central region are projected to spend more online than the would in store, so promoting the ecommerce store to this group looks promising.
o	Suggested next steps: 
♣	Online coupons:
•	Promote coupons with a higher minimum spend threshold to increase amount spent per transaction.
•	Ex. $100 off orders over $2000, since the Eastern region tends to spend below $2000. 
♣	Test offering lower discounted prices online than those offered in store to see if this increases online spend in these regions. 
♣	Shipping Options: 
•	Free shipping on any order or with a minimum amount spend are engaging promotions for customers
•	Fast turnaround on shipping times like 2 Day shipping can increase ecommerce customer satisfaction, especially during holidays.
