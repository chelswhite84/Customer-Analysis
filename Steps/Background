#Background 
Blackwell, an electronics retailer with 30 store locations in the Southeast, recently launched an eCommerce site within the
last year. Since they have started to gather online transaction data, the electronics retailer wants to utilize this
transaction data in order to inform their decisions about site-related activities, like online marketing, enhancements to the
site and so on, in order to continue to maximize the amount of revenue they generate from eCommerce sales.

I was presented with the following questions to guide my analysis. 
1. Do customers in different regions spend more per transaction? Which regions spend the most/least?
2. Are there differences in the age of customers between regions? If so, can we predict the age of a customer in a region    
   based on other demographic data? 
3. Can we predict the amount a customer will spend per transaction based on other data we have collected about that customer? 
4. Test Martinâ€™s Hypothesis: Is there any correlation between the age of a customer and if the transaction was made online or 
   in store? Do any other factors predict if a customer will buy online or in store?
